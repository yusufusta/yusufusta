Hello! My name is **Yusuf Usta**. I am writing codes from 2016. Unlike PHP, I first started writing the VB.NET language. My first goal when writing code is the security of the code.

**I usually write in PHP**,  If PHP is insufficient, I am using **Python** or **JS**. I also know more than the basics of System management (IT) and Pentest. The purpose of starting the software is that the Pentest tools I use are insufficient and I writing my own develop.

Despite having command of all operating systems, my favorite operating system is macOS.

I am a high school student, I do not have software related education. I learned everything from (`php.net, mozilla js docs, w3schools`) sites.
